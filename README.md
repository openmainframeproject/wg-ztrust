# ZTRUST Working Group

The ZTRUST working group exists to educate and inform members of
the Z (mainframe) community about cryptographic trust issues,
starting with code signing.

The working group also exists to provide a "trust anchor"
which can be used for verifying delivered code ("artifacts")
and related content.

## Goals

1. Education/Information

As of this writing, many members of the Z community remain unfamiliar
with trust anchors, cryptographic signing, PKI and PGP, and related
topics. This working group will fill the gaps.

2. Trust Anchor

While many trust anchors, trust paths, and trust chains already exist,
it seemed helpful to establish a community trust anchor for those
software deliverables and related services which fall outside of
established and commercial trust space.
