# Questions and Answers

Here are some common questions and some hopefully helpful answers.

* Q: 
Should customers be getting signed artifacts only?

* A:
It depends.
In the 21st century, there is increasing concern over supply chain.
In the software industry, that is specifically concern over the
(no surprise here) *software* supply chain. With respect to code signing,
regulators, administrators, and executives require assurance that the
software artifacts have not been tampered with.

The real answer to the question depends on the risks.
Any software which might impact production work or operations
must be trustworthy. Signed software extends the chain of trust
from the vendor to the user/consumer. Code signing is an increasingly
important means of conveying trust. In absence of a signature,
the software *must* come by way of a trustworthy channel.
