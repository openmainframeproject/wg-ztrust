We reviewed two of the initial documents, first "How-To.md".
Mike M and Brian H followed the steps in that document to create
their PGP keys. Rick recognized their faces and confirmed cryptographic
"fingerprints" of those public keys, will sign and upload.

The other doc reviewed was "Questions-Answers.md"
to which we added two more questions which will shortly have answers.

Jim Moling was not able to join in person, but sent an AI note-taker.

Mike Fulton could not attend but asked for a recording.
Jim's note-taker may have a partial recording. For reasons unknown,
Google Meet did not let us record this session.

Summary: two new PGP keys added
